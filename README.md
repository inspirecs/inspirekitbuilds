#InspireKit Builds

These are the final build results of the InspireKit application.

The files are intended to be pushed directly to the respective folders in InspireOS and deployed there.

To install InspireKit on your own system, simply unpack the contents of each folder to their respective place in your filesystem (this may require root permissions).

Thus, the contents of the folder "-usr-share-applications" is to be unpacked to /usr/share/applications/, etc.
